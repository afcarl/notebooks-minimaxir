# notebook

This GitHub Repository stores my R Notebooks, allowing GitHub Pages to serve the R Notebooks on my website without me having to include a redundant, heavy `index.html` in every corresponding repository. All the notebooks will be served from a `/notebooks/` folder, which has SEO benefits as well. (example: http://minimaxir.com/notebooks/first-comment/)

Refer to the original repository for each notebook where appropriate. (most are licensed MIT)
